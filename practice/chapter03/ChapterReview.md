# 1. Because this gives you option of choosing the integer type that best meets a programs's paticular requirements
# 2.short a = 80 ; unsigned int b = 42110 ; unsigned long c = 3000000000
# 3. Dependss on programmer's experience
# 4. The type of 33L is long，whereas the type of 33 is int.
# 5. Yes ,because the asc code of 'A' equal to 65.
# 6. cout << char (88)   char a = 88 ; cout << a
# 7. the answer depends on how large the two types are，in my system the long and longlong can reach 19 digits,which exceeds the 13 significant figure guaranteed for double
# 8. ommit
# 9. int a = int(x1) + int(x2) ; int (b) = x1 + x2
# 10. int float char char double
